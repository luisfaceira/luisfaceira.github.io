    content: >-
      I've started programming when I was a kid.
      In 2008 I've started my own software development shop with a strong emphasis on iterative methodologies, internal quality, and continuous delivery, which is now a team of ~50 consultants and is the technical arm of <a href="https://winning-consulting.com" target="_blank">Winning</a>.
      You can find out more about me in the dedicated page.

    title: What is this site?
    content: >-
      Besides being my professional presentation, this website is also my public notebook.
      You will find here a collection of patterns that I've found myself teaching to dozens of engineers that I've coached and leaded along the years.
      I find it particularly useful to assist in the process of code-reviewing.
